									<h1>What is<br />
									Sigma?</h1>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Purpose</h2>
								<p>Sigma is first and foremost an event for the SUTD family to come together to share and celebrate their collective summer experiences. It is an opportunity for students to showcase all the work they've done over the summer, for companies to meet and interact with prospective students, and most importantly for people to learn from one another and to build meaningful connections.</p>

								<h2>Why Sigma</h2>
								<div style="margin-left: 50px">
										<h5>If You're a Student</h5>
										<p>This is the moment for you to share everything you've done over the summer with your peers, and perhaps even your future employers. Not only is it a chance for you to celebrate your achievements, it is also an opportunity to learn about the kinds of work that other companies do, to network, and find out more about the industry that you might be working for in the future.</p>

										<h5>If You're a Company</h5>
										<p>Come take this chance to network with the students of SUTD and find out more about the things we do here! If you're already a partnered internship company with SUTD, you might find value in taking a look at what interns from other companies are doing to help enchance your own internship experience. If you're looking for potential internship/full-time hires, there are many students who are definitely keen to have a chat. Even if you aren't looking for prospective students, there could be showcases/presentations from research teams on technology that might relevant to your industry.

										<h5>If You're Neither</h5>
										<p>If you are neither a student nor from a company, there's no need to worry! The spirit of Sigma is learning for everyone, and there is always something new to discover. So come on down if you are simply curious about what we do here at SUTD and want to find out more.</p>
								</div>

								<h2>Structure</h2>
								<p>Sigma is a two-day event. The first day will be onsite at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and the second day would be offsite at a more central location (tbd). This structure is designed to encourage participation from members outside of our immediate community, increasing opportunities to network and grow.</p>

								<div style="margin-left: 50px">
									<h5>Lightning Talks</h5>
									<p>Several lightning talks will be delivered by selected individuals during the course of the event. There will be up to three talks held concurrently, and each talk will last around 10 minutes + 5 minutes for questions/overtime. The aim of these talks is to highlight outstanding projects and works, as well as to facilitate knowledge sharing and discussions. All talks will be recorded and uploaded at a later date.</p>
