									<h1>What is<br />
									Sigma?</h1>
								</header>
								<h2>Purpose</h2>
								<p>Sigma is <i>the</i> event for the SUTD Family to come together to share, celebrate and reflect on their collective summer experience. It is a place for students to showcase what they've done over the summer, for companies to meet and interact with students, and for people to learn from one another and build meaningful connections.</p>

								<h2>Why Sigma</h2>
								<div style="margin-left: 50px">
										<h5>If You're a Student</h5>
										<p>Share what you've done over the summer with your peers, and perhaps your future employers - and find out what your friends did too. Celebrate what you've achieved, and learn about the kinds of work that other companies undertake, network with industry players, and find out more about the industries that you'd like to work for.</p>

										<h5>If You're a Company</h5>
										<p>Seize this opportunity to discover the students of SUTD and find out more about what they do! If you're a partnered internship company with SUTD, come discover what students in other companies are doing and glean insight into enhancing your own company's operations. For companies seeking new talent, there are students aplenty who are keen to chat too. Even if you're not hiring or looking for interns, come see the showcases and presetations by SUTD's research community that may spark new ideas in your own!</p>

										<h5>If You're Neither</h5>
										<p>If you are neither a student nor from a company, there's no need to worry! The spirit of Sigma is learning for everyone, and there is always something new to discover. So, come on down if you're simply curious about what we do at SUTD and want to find out more.</p>
								</div>

								<h2>Structure</h2>
								<p>Sigma takes place over two days, an onsite and an offsite day in town. Wednesday will be onsite at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and Friday is located offsite at a more central location (tbd). This structure is designed to encourage participation from members outside of our immediate community, increasing opportunities for everyone to grow together.</p>

								<div style="margin-left: 50px">
									<h5>Keynote Speech</h5>
									<h5>Lightning Talks</h5>
									<p>Lightning Talks, 15-minute rapid-fire talks (10 presentation + 5 Q&A), will be delivered by selected individuals during the course of the event. Up to three talks will be held concurrently, meant to highlight outstanding projects and works, as well as facilitate knowledge-sharing and discussions. All talks will be recorded and uploaded at a later date.</p>
									<h5>Poster Showcase</h5>

									<h5>Offsite Showcase</h5>
